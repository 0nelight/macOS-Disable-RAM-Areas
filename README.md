# EFI Memory Patch Utility for macOS (Intel-CPUs)

**Currently the activation of this Utility needs a bit of effort. But if you put some effort into reading and understanding all the information, a lot of people can manage to get it working.** 

Are you experiencing system hangs or kernel panics on your Apple Mac or MacBook due to faulty memory? This EFI utility allows you to **disable defective memory regions** before macOS boots, preventing system crashes or unbootable Systems.

If you're receiving errors like:

- **PPM002, PPM003, PPM004...**: _"There may be an issue with the onboard memory."_

This utility offers a software solution by marking specific memory areas as defective, so macOS avoids them during runtime.

### Steps:
1. **Inform yourself**: Read through this README, [the Release-Notes](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/releases/tag/v0.2.1-beta) and the [Discussions-Page](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/discussions)
2. **Identify Faulty Memory**: Use diagnostic tools like [Memtest86+](https://www.memtest.org/) in Error-Summary-Mode to get the lowest and highest address of misbehaiving RAM.
3. **Run this EFI-Utility**: Use tools like [rEFInd](https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) to run this EFI-utility once before booting into macOS. This will mark the faulty RAM Area as unavailable for MacOS and therefore allowing a normal Operation of MacOs with only having a little bit less RAM.
4. **Boot MacOS**
5. **Automate Booting into MacOs with disabled RAM-Areas**: See [this Guide](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/discussions/3).
6. **You can check whether or not the area was disabled by executing this command in the Terminal:**  
```bash
sysctl -a | grep mem | grep Unusable
```
It should show something like this:
```bash
machdep.memmap.Unusable: 33562624 (Size of your disabled area)
```

It is intended for personal use only and serves as a workaround for users experiencing issues with defective memory on Apple Mac or MacBook devices.

## Important Note: Compatibility
This utility has been successfully in use for several years on my own **MacBook Pro (Late 2013)** running **macOS Big Sur**. Since uploading this EFI-Utility on Github it seems other people got it working too. For example on [Macbook Pro 2019 16'](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/discussions/3#discussioncomment-10753593) and someone writes from his success [in his Blog](https://derrick.blog/2025/02/28/how-i-saved-my-macbook-pro-from-bad-ram/). Please read the other Success-Stories on the [Issues-Page](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/issues?q=label%3Asuccess+is%3Aclosed) or consider [writing one yourself](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/issues/new?assignees=&labels=success&projects=&template=success-story.md&title=Success-Story) (please fill in your System Information) in case you found this Utility helpful. This tool doesn't work on Apple silicon Macs.

## Important Note: Other Solutions
A possibly more user-friendly tool to use to disable RAM-Areas before booting into MacOS would be using the "Open Core Legacy Patcher". [You configure your defective RAM-Areas in the config-file of OC](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/discussions/14) and there is no need to use the utility provided here. Please make sure your model [is compatible](https://github.com/0nelight/macOS-Disable-RAM-Areas/discussions/18) with the "Open Core Legacy Patcher" if you want to use this option.

## Motivation:
I see this as a great way to extend hardware lifespan, protect customer and shareholder value, and fight inflation by lowering demand for new devices, thus preserving the purchasing power of the dollar through more efficient resource use. 
Also such tools help keeping your soil and rivers less polluted from E-Waste and manufacturing waste material, which is good for your health and your health insurance.


## Why This Utility for Apple Mac and MacBook Users?
Many modern Apple devices, including Macs and MacBooks, come with memory chips soldered directly onto the motherboard. Replacing or reflowing these chips requires advanced tools and expertise, making hardware repair difficult and expensive.

This utility provides a **software-based workaround** by disabling defective memory blocks before macOS boots. Itâ€™s similar to the GNU GRUB `badram` command, but tailored for Apple hardware and macOS environments.

## Benefits:
- **No Costly Hardware Repair**: Solve memory-related issues without the need for expensive hardware repairs or professional services.
- **Extend the Life of Your Mac/MacBook**: Keep your Apple device running smoothly, even with defective memory regions.
- **Reduces E-Waste**: This tool extents the life of your Apple Computer and therefore reduces E-Waste.

ToDos (Contributions welcome!):
 - Testing with newer devices and newer macOs Versions
 - Provide better documentation (how to compile, "apt-get install gnu-efi")
