# Disables defective RAM Areas before booting into macOS
EFI Script to disable defective memory areas before booting macOS

Works on MacBook Pro Late 2013 on MacOS Big Sur.

You can use Tools like Refind to execute this script before booting MacOS.

ToDos:
 - More Testing
 - Add a few seconds delay to actually see the script executing (exits too fast to see anything)
 - Provide better documentation
